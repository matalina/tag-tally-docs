## Proceedure

A Creature in Tag & Tally is a collection of tags that can ease or hinder game play.

Follow the following simple steps to create a creature.

1. Create a concept of what you want the creature to be.
2. Design the creature sentence around this concept.
3. Give the creature a physical and behavioral weakness.
4. Pick a Damage type
5. Create 10 increasingly more advantageous skills, abilities or traits for the creature. These are the abilities a creature can access at the appropriate level and below. A creature cannot have a total of more than 10 Tiers above level one. (ie: 5 Tier 2 abilities, 3 Tier 3 abilities, 2 Tier 4 abilities and 1 Tier 2 ability, or any other combination totaling up to 10. Tier 1 abilities do not count.)
6. Write a description of the creature

## Creature Sentence

We lay out your creature sentence in the following format, and all tags are in square brackets.

{% sentence 'Creature', '[Name] is a [disposition] [descriptor] [type] who [motivation] and does [basic attack] damage.', 'dragon' %}

**Disposition:** should define how the creature behaves in most cases.

**Descriptors** should define a key trait or something about the creature that is its basic essence. This can be good or bad.

**Type:** should define the general type of the creature. Types can vary by setting.

**Motivation:** should define what drives the creatures instincts.

**Basic Attack** should be one of the allowed damage types in the setting.

## Example

### Miaserik is a \[feral] \[cunning] \[Chimera] who \[feeds on human terror] and does \[toxic] damage.

A tubular rat like creature with scales covering its head and tail, and fur covering the remainder of the body. The head is snake like with black beady eyes, fangs and a forked tongue. It is slightly longer than a rat and slithers on its belly using little rat like legs to propel it forward.

- **Physical Weakness:** Light & Cold Sensitivity
- **Behavioral Weakness:** Territorial Obsession

1. Toxic Hallucinogenic Bite
2. Hides in the Shadows
3. Pact Instinct
4. Resistant to Toxins
5. Collapsable Skeleton
6. Natural Armor [Tier 2]
7. Glamored Camoflauge [Tier 2]
8. Territorial Advantage
9. Self Healing Scales [Tier 2]
10. Venom of Dread [Tier 3] — venom also paralyzes the victim
