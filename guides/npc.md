## Proceedure

An NPC in Tag & Tally is a collection of tags that can ease or hinder game play.

Follow the following simple steps to create an NPC. 

1. Create a concept of what you want the npc to be.
2. Design the npc sentence around this concept.
3. Give the NPC a flaw, occupation and a background.
4. Pick a Damage type
5. Roll a d10. This determines the NPCs Level and the number of skills, ablitites and traits they have in addition to the ones they gain from their sentence. An NPC may have up to their level in tiered abilities (ie: at level 10, 5 Tier 2 abilities, 3 Tier 3 abilities, 2 Tier 4 abilities and 1 Tier 2 ability, or any other combination totaling up to 10. Tier 1 abilities do not count.)
6. Determine the basic information to help play the NPC

## Creature Sentence

We lay out your NPC sentence in the following format, and all tags are in square brackets.

> [!abstract] NPC
> **Name** is a \[descriptor\] \[species\] \[type\] who \[verbs\] \[something\] and does \[damage\] damage

**Descriptors** should define a key personality trait or something about the NPC that is a basic essence of the NPC. This can be good or bad,..

**Species** is just what it is. In an all human world or for a human NPC choose a second descriptor to fill in the sentence. The species of a NPC can tell a lot about what society perceives the NPC as. In some cases it could also be used in tasks that a species might be good at.

Include all species tags in your NPC sheet for easy reference under the species name.

> If you have a Psionic species. These NPCs are going to be really good with mental tasks, since that's what they're born to do. Mental tasks can be eased. But it also might make them vulnerable to psionics because they have a much more open mind. It's all about how your world works.

**Types** are what most other TTRPGs call classes or archetypes. They can range anywhere from Warrior as a most basic type to something as specific as Professional MMA Fighter.

You may choose two tier 1 skills or 1 tier 2 skill that are associated with your type to add under your type tag on your NPC sheet.

The **verbs something** tag is one of the most important bits. This is a major defining action for your NPC. It can go hand in hand with the type, or it can be something completely off the wall and go against the types typical associations. This is what your NPC is know for or uses to their advantage.

**Damage** indicates what type of damage an NPC does in combat.
