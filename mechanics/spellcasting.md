## Spellcasting

Any player character has access to magic if they so desire.

If a character has a tag that specifies they have access to a specific Aspect of magic the tag eases the task.

All characters if they have access to magic, have an MAI (Magical Aptitude Index). The MAI eases spell casting levels by the following table.

| MAI | Easing Bonus         |
| --: | -------------------- |
| 1–3 | None                 |
| 4–6 | Ease all spells by 1 |
| 7–9 | Ease all spells by 2 |
|  10 | Ease all spells by 3 |

All characters also have an assigned tier. Using the table below changes the spell level based on spell tier and character tier.

| Spell Tier vs Caster Tier | Effect                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Caster Tier > Spell Tier  | Ease spell level by 1   |
| Caster Tier = Spell Tier  | No change               |
| Caster Tier < Spell Tier  | Hinder spell level by 1 |

### Magial Aptitude Index (MAI)

The Magical Aptitude Index (MAI) measures a being’s innate connection to the fundamental forces of magic. It represents potential—how easily one can perceive, channel, and manipulate aetheric energy. A higher MAI reflects a naturally resonant essence, often tied to birthright, lineage, or cosmic phenomena. MAI begins with a base value set by species and modified by subspecies, descriptor, type, and specialization. Ultimately, MAI determines the ceiling of a caster’s magical capability, shaping both the scope and stability of their spell craft.

Each Species has a base MAI to start a character with. Sub-species may modify this number. For each Magical tag in the Character sentence you add +1 to the MAI number. (so up to +3 -- descriptor, type, and speciality)

### Caster Tier

Caster Tiers are based on MAI and modified by all character tags.

| MAI | Points |
| --- | ------ |
| 0–4 | +0     |
| 5   | +1     |
| 6   | +2     |
| 7   | +3     |
| 8   | +4     |
| 9   | +5     |
| 10  | +6     |

Add +1 for each magical tag for all life stages, descriptor, type, and specialty. Use the Tier of a tag as the plus if it has one.

| Total Points | Tier   |
| ------------ | ------ |
| 0-5          | Tier 1 |
| 6-10         | Tier 2 |
| 11-13        | Tier 3 |
| 14+          | Tier 4 |

## Spell Creation

Spells have a sentence like all other things in Tag & Tally.

> [!abstract] Spell
> **Name** is a \[descriptor\] \[base\] \[aspect\] \[type\] \[artifact\] that targets \[LEVEL\] \[things\] and \[does something\].

### Spell Tiers

To determine a spell’s Tier, assign points for each of its five factors: Aspect, Type, Base, Artifact, and Level/Target.

Use the predefined point values, sum the points from all five factors to get a total. Compare the total to the Tier mapping. The resulting Tier reflects the spell’s complexity, power, and risk.

| Aspect                                         | Points |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| earth, air, water, death, illusion (low-risk)  | 1      |
| fire, mind, light, sound (moderate)            | 2      |
| shadow, time, life, space (high-risk/volatile) | 3      |

| Type    | Points |
| ------- | ------ |
| Damage  | 2      |
| Control | 3      |
| Summon  | 3      |
| Ward    | 2      |
| Counter | 3      |

| Base   | Points |
| ------ | ------ |
| Order  | 1      |
| Spirit | 2      |
| Chaos  | 3      |
| Void   | 3      |

| Artifact      | Points      |
| ------------- | ----------- |

| Proto Rune    | 3           |
| Incantation   | 2           |
| Somatic       | 2           |
| Ritual        | 1 (easiest) |
| Science       | 2           |

| Level/Target      | Points |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Self, 1–2 targets | 1      |
| 3–5 targets       | 2      |
| 6–10 targets      | 3      |
| AoE / large scale | 4      |

## Casting a Spell

| d20          | Result       | Details                                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1            | Fail, and    | Fail, and Roll on the Mishap table                                              |
| 2 to DC-6    | Fail, but    | The spell fails, but nothing backfires or goes wrong                            |
| DC-5 to DC-1 | Success, but | Success, but it backfires and hinders all rolls until the end of your next turn |
| DC to DC+4   | Success      | The spell goes off exactly as you expected                                      |
| DC+5 +       | Success, and | Successfully cast the spell and earn the tag of Mastery for that spell.         |

Mastery of a spell eases the level of the spell by one. A spell can only be mastered once.

If you roll a Natural 20 for any DC you also gain Mastery of that spell.

A character may also spend downtime of 2d6 weeks Mastering a Spell. A character may only study one spell at a time.

### Blood Magic

Blood magic is rare and evil. Blood magic requires the user to specifically take the tag "**Uses Blood Magic**" in order to actually have access to it. It may be applied at Character Creation but must be earned through a Character Arc at any other time.

To cast a spell with Blood Magic you must sacrifice part of yourself or another living creature of the appropriate level.

This sacrifice will ease the spell casting by two and the target sacrifice will gain 1 lingering trauma wound. If the living creature is below level 3 it is instantly killed. The damage type for this is necrotic.

### Mishaps

Mishaps happen when a spell goes awry.

| 6   | Roll twice on the table and they both happen                                                              |
