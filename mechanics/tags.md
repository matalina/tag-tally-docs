## Tags

Tags are the basis of all descriptive sentences in Story Mode. Tags should always ease or hinder one or more actions.

Tags can be used with justification to ease any task. But there is a limit to how many tags you can apply to any given task. This is know as the Task Threshold.

- Each source counts as 1, regardless of how much it eases.
- You may use a maximum of 2 gear or physical assets to ease tasks.
- A source's tier determines how many steps it eases by.
- You must justify each source as relevant to the task at hand.
- There is no cap on hindrance -- flaws and condition tags can still raise the difficulty.

| Task Level | Task Threshold |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| 0–3        | 2              |
| 4–6        | 3              |
| 7–8        | 4              |
| 9–10       | 5              |

Hindrances apply _after_ easing sources have been calculated and the task Level has been reduced. Multiple hindrances stack, and there is no cap.

There are several types of Tags.

- scene tags
- background tags
- trait tags
- skill/ability tags
- flaw/weakness tags
- reputation tags
- condition tags

These tags can fall into different category of tags

- generic tags
- umbrella tags
- tiered tags
- temporary tags
- permanent tags

## Tag Categories

### Generic

A **generic tag** represents a singular skill, trait or property of a character. Your descriptor tag is a generic tag.

### Umbrella

An **umbrella tag** represents a group of other tags, skills, traits and properties that anyone with the tag possess. These tags are typically in your character sentence: type, species and does something.

### Tiered Tags

A **tiered tag** can be either a generic or umbrella tag, but a tiered tag has a tier that you can increase its effective mechanics by preforming quests or completing specific arcs or actions as a reward. Your type tag is a tiered tag.

Tiered Tags have 4 levels and ease or hinder a task by the level of the tier.

| Level | Tier    |
| ----- | ------- |
| 1     | Novice  |
| 2     | Skilled |
| 3     | Expert  |
| 4     | Master  |

A **generic tag** can be tiered.

An **umbrella tag** can be tiered. However an umbrella tag can only have up to 10 maximum tags underneath it. And a total of ten tiers levels.

> **Example**
>
> 4 skills could have tiers of 4, 3, 2, 1 and no other skills underneath the umbrella tag, but there could be 6 background, trait or other tag types that are not tiered
>
> 3 skills could have tiers of 4, 4, 2
>
> 5 skills could have tiers of 2 each
>
> 10 untired tags

### Temporary Tags

A **temporary tag** is usually a condition tag that has a set duration it is active until it is removed.

### Permanent Tags

A **permanent tag** is a tag that cannot be removed from an attached item.

## Tag Types

### Scene Tags

A **scene tag** represent temporary conditions, environmental factors, or narrative elements that affect all participants within a scene.

Scene tags are always applied if applicable and do not count against the number of tags used to ease a player's tasks (even if it is easing the task).

### Background Tags

A **background tag** represents something that changed them in the past that has an effect on how the attached item preforms tasks, interact with others, etc.

Background tags are **generic tags**. They cannot be tiered.

### Flaw/Weakness Tags

A **flaw tag** or a **weakness tag** represents a mostly detrimental trait of the attached item that has an effect how the attached item preforms tasks, interact with others, etc.

Flaw/Weakness tags are **generic tags**. They cannot be tiered.

### Reputation Tags

A **reputation tag** represents a relationship between two sentient beings that has an effect how the attached item interact with other.
