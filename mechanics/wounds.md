## Wounds

Wounds are tags that hinder appropriate actions and tasks.

A wound can be treated in the field by successfully passing a Level 5 Field treatment check. For each attempt after the first the task is hindered by one for each additional try. On a successful check you may heal 1 strain, or downgrade 1 other wound except a Lasting Scar.

You may Field treat a wound only directly after combat. You may not try again in another scene.

Wounds can be treated by someone with the appropriate knowledge (doctor/barber etc) with a Level 3 Treat Injury check. For each attempt after the first the task is hindered by one for each additional try. On a successful check strains and lingering traumas are removed or one debilitating injury is downgraded to a lingering trauma.

You may only be treated by a professional once per session.

Wounds may be healed by magic by successfully passing a Level 3 Treat Injury check. On a successful check all wound except a Lasting Scar are healed, or 1 Lasting Scar that can be healed is healed. However, if a Lasting Scar with a missing body part is immediately healed after the fight AND the missing body part is present, the wound can be healed completely. If any time elapses, the missing piece may not be reattached and the character should apply a new tag such as can't see out of right eye, or can't hear out of left year, has a peg leg or some other tag that represents their new condition in order to remove the Lasting Scar penalty.

You may only be healed magically once per session.

Lasting Scars may only be healed with magic or over a Long Downtime period of rest and healing.

When a character rests in a safe zone, they can heal all strains or 1 Lingering Trauma or downgrade 1 Debilitating Injury to a Lingering Trauma.

> Safe zones are consider to be guarded settlements with proper lodgings. You cannot make a safe rest on the road or in a dungeon.

## Lasting Scars

> [!abstract] Lasting Scar
> The Lasting Scar is a \[descriptor] \[type of mark] located on \[the body part] that \[specific mechanical detriment].

Lasting Scars heal over a Long Downtime period of recovery.

When healed the Lasting Scar does not regenerate missing body parts. The character applies a new tag describing how they've overcome the limitation.

## Healing

Healing Magic is always a ritual and cannot be cast in combat.
