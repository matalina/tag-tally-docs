## Combat Mechanics

Player makes all rolls.

A player and creature can take 1 action and move a 30ft on their turn in any given round.

Each round a player may make one reaction to some event that happens while it is not their turn such as counter a spell or block an attack against an ally from a creature with in 5ft.

## Initiative

Creatures initiative is determined by 3 times there level (their DC).

Each Player will then roll their d20 using any modifications to ease or hinder their rolls.

If the player rolls higher than the creature's DC they go first.

If the player rolls lower than the creature. The creature goes first.

If the player matches the DC of the creature initiative the player goes first.

In a group, all players higher or lower than the creature decides the order they go. And the order can change each round with in the player group of higher or lower initiatives.

## Armor

Armor eases defense and hinders stealth and decreases carrying capacity by 1.

| Armor  | Ease Defense | Hinder Stealth | Carrying Capacity Reduced |
| ------ | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Light  | 1 step       | 0 steps        | 0                         |
| Medium | 2 steps      | 1 step         | 0                         |
| Heavy  | 3 steps      | 2 steps        | 1                         |

## Momentum

During combat the scene has a Momentum clock equal to 5 plus the number of PCs in the scenario. Using the table below to adjust the clock. The clock starts at zero. And the sequence ends when the clock is filled or when the enemies total number of successes equals the momentum clock total (5 plus the number of PCs).

| d20          | Result       | Player Attack | Player Defense            |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1            | Fail, and    | 0             | -2 momentum/+2 enemy hit  |
| 2 to DC-6    | Fail, but    | 0             | -1 momentum/+1 enemy hit  |
| DC-5 to DC-1 | Success, but | 0             | -1 momoentum/+0 enemy hit |
| DC to DC+4   | Success      | +1 momentum   | 0                         |
| DC+5 +       | Success, and | +2 momentum   | 0                         |

A successful player attack increases momentum.

A failed player defense decreases momentum and adds to the enemies total number of success.

At the end of combat, the total number of successful hits on the enemies clock is the amount of 'damage' the party received. Using the wounds table decide what wound the characters receive.
