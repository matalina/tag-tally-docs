## Combat Mechanics

The player makes all rolls.

A player and creature can take 1 action and move a 30ft on their turn in any round.

Each round, a player may make one reaction to some event that happens while it is not their turn, such as countering a spell or blocking an attack against an ally from a creature within 5ft.

## Initiative

A creature's initiative is determined by 3 times their level (their DC).

Each player will then roll their d20 using any modifications to ease or hinder their rolls.

If the player rolls higher than the creature's DC, they go first.

If the player rolls lower than the creature. The creature goes first.

If the player matches the DC of the creature initiative, the player goes first.

In a group, all players higher or lower than the creature decide the order they go. And the order can change each round within the player group of higher or lower initiatives.

## Armor

Armor eases defense and hinders stealth and decreases carrying capacity by 1.

| Armor  | Ease Defense | Hinder Stealth | Carrying Capacity Reduced |
| ------ | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Light  | 1 step       | 0 steps        | 0                         |
| Medium | 2 steps      | 1 step         | 0                         |
| Heavy  | 3 steps      | 2 steps        | 1                         |

## Momentum & Doom

During combat, the scene has a Momentum clock equal to 5 plus the number of PCs in the scenario. Use the table below to adjust the clock. The clock starts at zero. And the sequence ends when either the Momentum or Doom clock are filled.

| d20          | Result       | Player Attack | Player Defense       |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------- | -------------------- |
| 1            | Fail, and    | 0             | -2 momentum/+2 doom  |
| 2 to DC-6    | Fail, but    | 0             | -1 momentum/+1 doom  |
| DC-5 to DC-1 | Success, but | 0             | -1 momoentum/+0 doom |
| DC to DC+4   | Success      | +1 momentum   | 0                    |
| DC+5 +       | Success, and | +2 momentum   | 0                    |

A successful player attack increases momentum.

A failed player defense decreases momentum and adds doom.

At the end of combat, the total number of segments on the Doom clock is the amount of 'damage' the party received. Using the wounds table, decide what wound the characters receive.

| Segments | 1 PC                | 2 PC                | 3 PC                | 4+ PCs              |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1        | --                  | --                  | --                  | --                  |
| 2        | Strain              | --                  | --                  | --                  |
| 3        | Strain              | Strain              | --                  | --                  |
| 4        | Lingering Trauma    | Strain              | Strain              | --                  |
| 5        | Debilitating Injury | Lingering Trauma    | Strain              | Strain              |
| 6        | Lasting Scar        | Debilitating Injury | Lingering Trauma    | Strain              |
| 7        | --                  | Lasting Scar        | Debilitating Injury | Lingering Trauma    |
| 8        | --                  | --                  | Lasting Scar        | Debilitating Injury |
| 9+       | --                  | --                  | --                  | Lasting Scar        |

Choose or roll on the wounds table based on the encounter's main damage type if you need inspiration for the type of wound received.
