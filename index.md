**Tag & Tally** is a narrative-first tabletop RPG where every thing is defined by two things &mdash; a sentence and a level. The sentence tells you what it is; The number tells you how tough they are.

Tag &amp; Tall is designed for solo first, but cooperative or GM-led stories work perfectly well.

The system runs on tags that shape your actions and tallies that track momentum, wounds, and stakes.

You won’t need pages of stats. Just a line that speaks **your** truth.

**What's your line?**
