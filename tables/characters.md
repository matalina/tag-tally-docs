| 1   | You learned to read people fast — or be taken advantage of.       | Everyone knew your name — and your business.                       |
| 2   | You got lost in the crowd once — and no one noticed.              | You broke a local tradition and became the town’s cautionary tale. |
| 3   | You made a lifelong friend on the subway or street corner.        | You helped at a family shop or farm from a young age.              |
| 4   | You watched a protest or riot unfold from your bedroom window.    | The annual festival was the highlight of your year.                |
| 5   | You knew how to avoid cops, gangs, or both.                       | You knew every neighbor’s dog by name.                             |
| 6   | A strange figure visited your apartment building every full moon. | You swore you saw something unnatural in the woods.                |
| 7   | You climbed rooftops to feel free, just for a few minutes.        | You were caught sneaking out and your parents still talk about it. |
| 8   | You hustled or worked to help support your family.                | You couldn’t wait to leave — and still can’t.                      |
| 9   | You witnessed magic — but no one around you would talk about it.  | Magic was rare, but when it showed up, it changed everything.      |
| 10  | You ran with a crew or clique that shaped who you are.            | A local legend or ghost story marked your childhood.               |

| d10 | Nomad/Traveler                                                      | Off the Grid                                                   |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You learned to pack everything you owned in under ten minutes.      | You didn’t see another child for most of your early life.      |
| 2   | You crossed a border that no map ever marked.                       | You learned to hunt or forage before you could read.           |
| 3   | You were taught to lie about where you came from.                   | A solar flare or storm cut you off from the outside world.     |
| 4   | You changed your name so often you forgot your real one.            | Your family had a rule: never speak to strangers.              |
| 5   | You once stayed in a place so beautiful, you almost stayed forever. | You were raised with a deep fear of cities or crowds.          |
| 6   | You learned stories in ten different tongues, none your own.        | You built your first shelter before you turned ten.            |
| 7   | You lost something important at a rest stop and never found it.     | You were responsible for fetching water or tending fire daily. |
| 8   | You witnessed something amazing — and no one else believes it.      | You didn’t see a paved road until much later in life.          |
| 9   | You danced with strangers under the stars and never saw them again. | You had to defend your home from wild creatures.               |
| 10  | You were told: “Keep moving, or they’ll find us.”                   | You never had power or running water — and didn’t miss them.   |

| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 2   | You helped deliver a child in the middle of a storm.        | A mentor singled you out — and then disappeared.                 |
| 3   | You lived by a schedule drawn by the whole community.       | You formed a forbidden friendship with someone on the “outside.” |
| 4   | Your commune survived a disaster together — barely.         | You ran away once — and were caught.                             |
| 5   | You were chosen to represent the group in a ritual or task. | You memorized rules like they were scripture.                    |
| 6   | You caught someone stealing from the stores.                | You were isolated for breaking a rule you didn’t understand.     |
| 7   | You once lived in silence for a month as part of a vow.     | You witnessed something terrible no one would believe.           |
| 8   | You grew your own food, built your own shelter.             | You spent nights studying while others slept.                    |
| 9   | You questioned the leaders — and faced consequences.        | You earned privileges — and the resentment of others.            |
| 10  | You were told you were chosen for something greater.        | You never knew your last name until the day you left.            |

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You danced with spirits under a blood moon.                  | You wandered too far and something watched you from the dark.                |
| 2   | A mischievous fey stole your voice for a year.               | You bartered with a shadow-creature and still owe a debt.                    |
| 3   | You were chosen by a forest guardian for a secret task.      | You served in the home of a Nether noble who spoke in riddles.               |
| 4   | You were lost in a grove where time didn't flow right.       | You lived in a place where day never came.                                   |
| 5   | A plant you nurtured became sentient and speaks only to you. | You saw a mirror version of yourself that whispered truths.                  |
| 6   | You befriended a changeling — then watched them vanish.      | You were taught to read hidden signs in shadows and smoke.                   |
| 7   | You were cursed for breaking an oath and learned the cost.   | You broke a rule and glimpsed a forbidden memory not your own.               |
| 8   | You trained in ritual song and dance under moonlight.        | You memorized names of the dead to keep their spirits calm.                  |
| 9   | You won a contest of stories with a trickster spirit.        | You watched a place get swallowed by the dark, and no one else remembers it. |
| 10  | You briefly became an animal and never told anyone.          | You woke up far from home with a shadow stitched to your feet.               |

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You joined a street crew, gang, or activist circle for protection or purpose.               | You were crowned at a town festival — and held to impossible standards.                   |
| 2   | You uncovered a major secret in your neighborhood — and were threatened to keep it.         | You uncovered a supernatural presence in an abandoned place.                              |
| 3   | You started working nights in a part of the city no one talks about.                        | You rebelled against a town elder and caused a scandal.                                   |
| 4   | A friend disappeared without a trace, and no one believed you when you said why.            | You made a pact or promise with something that lived just beyond the cornfields or hills. |
| 5   | You learned how to hack, forge, or bypass urban systems to get by.                          | You dated someone “off-limits” and learned how cruel gossip could be.                     |
| 6   | You were caught up in a magical crackdown or anti-magic protest.                            | You helped hide someone — or something — from outsiders.                                  |
| 7   | You trained under a mentor who used the city’s chaos as your classroom.                     | You were expected to inherit something you didn’t want — land, a job, a burden.           |
| 8   | You witnessed a crime involving magic or power — and stayed silent.                         | You left for a time and came back different, or never quite fit in again.                 |
| 9   | You entered a shadow economy that taught you more than school ever did.                     | You discovered your family wasn’t who you thought they were.                              |
| 10  | You fell in love with someone from the other side of the city’s veils — and it changed you. | You performed in or interrupted a town ritual with long-standing consequences.            |

| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 3   | You were mistaken for someone important, and played along too long.         | You created something incredible — and then had to destroy it.                    |
| 4   | You helped guide others through a place you'd never return to.              | You were left alone for weeks to “prove yourself.”                                |
| 5   | You made a map no one believes is accurate.                                 | You became guardian of a boundary stone, relic, or secret no one else could know. |
| 6   | You were caught between two territories, cultures, or powers.               | You broke your family’s biggest rule and saw the world beyond.                    |
| 7   | You found a place that almost convinced you to settle down.                 | You witnessed something powerful fall from the sky.                               |
| 8   | You smuggled something or someone across dangerous lines.                   | You were nearly discovered by those your guardians feared.                        |
| 9   | You betrayed someone to ensure survival — and never told anyone.            | You started a journal or record of the outside world no one believed.             |
| 10  | You lost your name and were given a new one in a rite or rite of passage.   | You left and returned — and things weren’t the same.                              |

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You were accused of selfishness and exiled for a time.                         | You were caught up in a quiet rebellion that changed the rules.                  |
| 2   | You became the voice of others — and were punished for it.                     | You were used as an example — either to inspire or to shame.                     |
| 3   | You initiated or stopped a cultural split within your community.               | You made a deal with someone outside the institution.                            |
| 4   | You kept a secret that protected someone but harmed the group.                 | You uncovered a file or record that changed what you thought you knew.           |
| 5   | You created something — a ritual, invention, or story — that became tradition. | You spent time in solitary or under observation.                                 |
| 6   | You broke from your assigned role and had to earn forgiveness.                 | You befriended a guard, warden, or instructor who saw potential in you.          |
| 7   | You fell in love with someone forbidden by your community’s rules.             | You were denied an opportunity for reasons they wouldn’t explain.                |
| 8   | You uncovered a truth about the commune’s founders that shook everything.      | You led a group that failed — and took the blame.                                |
| 9   | You were injured while saving someone — or chose not to.                       | You exposed corruption — or became part of it.                                   |
| 10  | You left for a time and returned different — or not welcomed at all.           | You vanished for a week inside the institution — and no one would talk about it. |

| d10 | The Wyld                                                                           | The Nether                                                                      |

| 1   | You witnessed a Wild Hunt — and it noticed you.                                    | You watched something crawl out of a mirror — and learned its name.             |
| 2   | You made a pact with a lesser fey, and it's still bound to you.                    | You walked through a place where sound doesn’t exist.                           |
| 3   | You crossed a glade where your reflection didn’t follow you.                       | You made a promise to a shadow you thought was your own.                        |
| 4   | You were taken as a guest by a Court — and barely returned.                        | You helped guide a spirit across, and it clings to you.                         |
| 5   | You began to change, physically or emotionally, in ways no one explained.          | You were marked by a forgotten god — and others can sense it.                   |
| 6   | You were gifted a name that’s not your own — and it’s stronger than your true one. | You trained under a master of veils and illusions.                              |
| 7   | You walked the spiral path to the heart-tree and touched its bark.                 | You found an old ruin where everyone remembered your face.                      |
| 8   | You stole something sacred and it follows you still.                               | You hid from something ancient — and it still remembers the scent of your fear. |
| 9   | You witnessed the birth of something divine, or monstrous.                         | You inherited a family relic that reacts to the darkness.                       |
| 10  | You sang the wrong song and changed the weather.                                   | You slipped between realities — and brought something back.                     |

| 5   | You found purpose here you couldn't find elsewhere.                 |

| 1   | You burned bridges in your old city and had to disappear.       | You were told to leave after something went wrong.           |
| 2   | You followed a case, cause, or clue to New Everlight’s shadows. | You wanted anonymity — to blend in and vanish.               |
| 3   | You believed the magic here would give you an edge.             | You sought opportunity your home could never offer.          |
| 4   | You’re chasing someone — or running from them.                  | You tracked someone from your town who disappeared here.     |
| 5   | Your skills translated well to this city’s underworld or elite. | You brought a relic or secret the city needs — or wants.     |
| 6   | You were hired, recruited, or conscripted by someone in power.  | You were running from small-town judgment or laws.           |
| 7   | You needed a fresh start somewhere no one knew your name.       | You thought your magic or curse might be controlled here.    |
| 8   | Your past caught up with you — and pointed you here.            | You fell for someone who brought you with them.              |
| 9   | You made a deal, and the city was part of the bargain.          | You came to learn something the town tried to keep from you. |
| 10  | You saw New Everlight in a dream — and felt drawn to it.        | You followed the pull of something older than either place.  |

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You were hired to guide someone — and got stuck.                 | You were exiled or cast out by your guardians.                        |
| 2   | You stopped to resupply and couldn’t leave.                      | You came seeking answers to questions no one around you could answer. |
| 3   | You lost your map — or your route — in or near the city.         | You had a vision — or a warning — about the city.                     |
| 4   | You’re chasing a myth rooted beneath the city streets.           | You’re protecting something the city doesn’t know it needs.           |
| 5   | You’re hunting someone with a city face and desert soul.         | You’re looking for others like you.                                   |
| 6   | You believe a key to your past is locked within this place.      | You brought something dangerous — and need to hide it.                |
| 7   | You needed shelter — or anonymity — only a sprawl could give.    | You saw the city in a dream that felt like a prophecy.                |
| 8   | You got caught in a Veilstorm, and this is where you landed.     | You were lured here by promises too tempting to resist.               |
| 9   | You owe someone in the city — or they owe you.                   | You came to end or avenge a family curse tied to this place.          |
| 10  | You followed omens or visions that led here without explanation. | You want to burn the world and start with New Everlight.              |

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You were sent as an emissary, scout, or spy.                        | You escaped your institution and came here to hide.                   |
| 2   | You left willingly to learn what life was like beyond your enclave. | You were released and told to report to someone here.                 |
| 3   | You betrayed your people — or they betrayed you.                    | You’re investigating someone from the same institution.               |
| 4   | You came to spread your values, beliefs, or magic.                  | You were transferred here as part of a larger system.                 |
| 5   | You’re searching for someone who once left your commune.            | You’re here to earn your freedom, penance, or reputation.             |
| 6   | You came to collect something owed to your community.               | You came to learn — but found yourself unlearning everything.         |
| 7   | You were exiled for breaking one of the unspoken rules.             | You’re building a new identity from the rubble of the old one.        |
| 8   | You came for sanctuary — and found the opposite.                    | You were called here by a mentor, ghost, or coded message.            |
| 9   | You believe your people were wrong — and this city might prove it.  | You want to shut the whole system down — and the rot starts here.     |
| 10  | You carry a truth or artifact meant to awaken the city.             | You thought you were free, but something in the city is watching you. |

| d10 | The Wyld                                                                          | The Nether                                                                |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You were cast out after breaking a Fey law — one even you don’t fully understand. | You were told to watch someone — and New Everlight is where they fled.    |
| 2   | You chased someone (or something) that escaped from the Wyld into the city.       | You’re here to silence a secret that should never have left the shadows.  |
| 3   | You’re here on a mission from a Fey Court — whether or not you still serve them.  | You were summoned — by name — through a spell, dream, or mirror.          |
| 4   | You lost a duel, challenge, or riddle, and exile to the city was your punishment. | You lost something in the city long ago, and it’s time to retrieve it.    |
| 5   | You heard your true name whispered from New Everlight — and followed it.          | You’re part of a pact or shadow network based in the city's underlayer.   |
| 6   | You seek a way to sever your ties to the Wyld, once and for all.                  | You were promised power if you came — and you're here to collect.         |
| 7   | You brought a piece of the Wyld with you — intentionally or not.                  | You came to prevent something terrible from crossing over.                |
| 8   | You fled a prophecy or fate the Wyld laid upon you.                               | You’re dying — or unraveling — and believe the cure is here.              |
| 9   | You seek vengeance for a wrong done to your grove, court, or kin.                 | You followed a trail of shadows and blood, and it ended in New Everlight. |
| 10  | You’re spying for the Wyld — and pretending not to be.                            | You don’t remember arriving — but you know you can’t leave.               |
