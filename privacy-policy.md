Tag and Tally respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use our documentation, app, or Discord bot (collectively, the “Services”).
### 1. Data We Do **Not** Collect

Tag and Tally does **not**:
- Collect personal information
- Store user data on our servers
- Track users across sessions or platforms
- Use analytics, tracking pixels, or advertising identifiers
- Sell, rent, or share user data
- Train AI or machine learning models on user content
### 2. How Data Is Handled

Any data created or used while interacting with Tag and Tally is handled in one of the following ways:
- **Local Storage:**  Data may be stored locally in your browser or device storage.
- **User-Controlled Cloud Storage:**  If enabled, data may be saved to cloud storage **you explicitly authorize** (for example, your own account or provider).
At no point is this data transmitted to, stored on, or processed by Tag and Tally servers.
### 3. Discord Bot Data

- The Discord bot does not persistently store messages, user IDs, server IDs, or commands.
- All processing occurs in real time to respond to commands.
- No logs or historical records are retained by Tag and Tally.

Discord itself may collect data independently under its own privacy policy.
### 4. User-Generated Content

- You retain full ownership of any content you create or submit.
- Tag and Tally does not archive, reuse, or analyze this content.
- Submitted content is **not** used for AI training, profiling, or data analysis.
### 5. Third-Party Services

Tag and Tally does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or data brokers.

However, third-party platforms you use (such as Discord, browsers, or cloud storage providers) may collect data according to their own policies. Tag and Tally is not responsible for those practices.
### 6. Children’s Privacy

Tag and Tally does not knowingly collect personal data from anyone, including children under 13. Because no personal data is collected, no age-based data processing occurs.
### 7. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in the Services. Updates will be published alongside the documentation or app. Continued use indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
