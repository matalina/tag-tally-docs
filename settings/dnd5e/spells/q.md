Quake is a complex Chaos Earth Damage Manifestation that targets LEVEL 1 things and unleashes a violent, localized tremor, dealing massive damage and creating difficult terrain. (Tier 3)
Quickening is a basic Order Time Control Somatic that targets LEVEL 1 things and allows the caster to take a second, limited action immediately (Sorcerer Metamagic approximation). (Tier 2)
