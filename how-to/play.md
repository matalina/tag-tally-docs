To start playing we need to answer a few questions.

Where? Who? What and Why? We've shown you the answer to the question "How?" in the previous section.

## Where?

_Create a Setting or backdrop for the characters to exist in_

First thing we need to know is where are we going to be playing. You can use the tables to assist you in your thought process.

> [!example] > **Genre:** Urban Fantasy
>
> - Modern World
> - **Magic:** Low Magic -- magic exists but it is hard to come-by
>   - **Access:** PCs have access, but most regular folks do not
> - **Technology:** High Technology -- technology and science exist and are easy to come-by
>   - **Access:** Everyone has access

This sets the stage for what your characters can do.

| Magic      | Tech      | Example Genres                                                                               |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High Magic | No Tech   | High Fantasy, Mythic Fantasy, Sword & Sorcery, Fairy Tale, Folk Horror                       |
| High Magic | Low Tech  | Heroic Fantasy, Dark Fantasy, Historical Fantasy, Wuxia, Arthurian Legend                    |
| High Magic | High Tech | Magitech, Science Fantasy, Arcane Punk, Steampunk, Space Fantasy, Urban Fantasy              |
| Low Magic  | No Tech   | Low Fantasy, Gritty Fantasy, Survival Fantasy, Grimdark, Prehistoric Fiction                 |
| Low Magic  | Low Tech  | Medieval Fiction, Historical Drama, Western Fantasy, Sword & Sandal, Swashbuckling Adventure |
| Low Magic  | High Tech | Post-Apocalyptic, Cyberpunk with Occult Elements, Dystopian Fantasy, Biopunk                 |
| No Magic   | No Tech   | Prehistoric Fiction, Historical Fiction, Survival Horror, Hard Drama, Naturalistic Adventure |

# Who?

_The characters are the heart of the story._

1. Come up with a compelling Character Concepts.
2. Create a character sentence for each character.
3. (optional) Flesh out the character with a [[101-Character Creation]] method.

### Character Sentence

> [!important] Character Sentence
> \[Name] is a \[descriptor] \[species] \[type] who \[does something].

This sentence defines the characters at a high grain detail.

Each of the words in the brackets are tags that describe your character. They can be used to ease or hinder an action check.

**Descriptors** should define a key personality trait or something about the character that is a basic essence of the character. This can be good or bad, it is your character.

**Species** is just what it is. In an all human world or for a human character choose a second descriptor to fill in the sentence. The species of a character can tell a lot about what society perceives the character as. In some cases it could also be used in tasks that a species might be good at.

> [!example]
> If you have a Psionic species. These characters are going to be really good with mental tasks, since that's what they're born to do. Mental tasks can be eased. But it also might make them vulnerable to psionics because they have a much more open mind. It's all about how your world works.

**Types** are what most other TTRPGs call classes or archetypes. They can range anywhere from Warrior as a most basic type to something as specific as Professional MMA Fighter.

The **Specialty** tag is one of the most important bits. This is a major defining action for your character. It can go hand in hand with the type, or it can be something completely off the wall and go against the types typical associations. This is what your character is know for or uses to their advantage.

> [!example]
>
> - Uses Magic
> - Wields Two Weapons
> - Made a Deal with a Devil
> - Entertains the Masses

The phrase should always start with a verb. While is, can or has are perfectly acceptable ways to start the sentence, try looking for action verbs instead.

You can enhance this character by using the Character Creation rules.

## What and Why?

_What is the purpose of the game_

Now that you have your characters and your setting it's time to think about what the character(s) are going to do. There are several methods you go could about doing this. I like The Oracle Method and the Quest Method.

### The Oracle Method

If you have no idea start asking the Oracle questions. Some that are good to start with.

- Have the characters already met?
- Are the characters in a settlement?
- Do they have a mission?
- Do they work for anyone?

These questions will lead to other questions and you can surmise a beginning to your story.

### The Quest Method

Sometimes you there is a general theme you want to do or don't want to have to interpret as much as with the Oracle method. That's where the Quest Method comes in.

You create a few random tables that help assist you in creating a decent quest idea that will help fuel the story forward.

Quest need a set of things before you can begin.

- A starting location
- A source of the quest
- The type of quest it is
- What is the objective of the quest
- What is the reward? or Why are you doing the quest?
- Where is the objective of the quest found?

> [!example] Collect Antidote Ingredients
> **Starting Location:** Home Village
> **Source:** Village apothecary
> **Type:** Collection
> **Objective:** Collect the ingredients for the antidote
> **Reward:** A small bag of gold + Saving an NPC you need to speak to
> **Location:** Varies/Multiple

## How?

_The most important part -- have fun_

Now you have a quest for your characters to go on in the world you've created. But how do you start?

The Mechanics Chapter contains all the basic rules you need for playing the game.

First things first, figure out how you find the source of the quest. You can already know how you did that or you can ask the oracle. If you don't know something, as the oracle.

Sometimes you need a better answer than Yes or No, or you need help interpreting the random keywords that the app gives you. Don't be afraid to consult other mediums for assistance. (Me personally, I like asking AI and using what I like from its suggestions to inspire the next thing.)

This is your game, and you should play it how you want to. This is what I do.

### Starting a Scene

All Scenes should have a level between 1 and 6. In Solo play roll 1d4+2 to get the scene level between 3 and 6 which makes the scene non-trivial. A GM may assign each scene a level.

Scenes may have various modifying tags assigned to it that always apply.

Environmental Tags such a Rainy Day, Nighttime, and Rough Terrain are examples of tags that could be applied to a scene.

In GM-less play, it might be beneficial to add a play order using either a round robin or highest to lowest roll on a d20 to determine order of acting questions to the oracle and setting up game dynamics.

With a GM, the GM provides a description and the players react, the same play order may be used, or moderated by the GM, however is decided is best for the table.
